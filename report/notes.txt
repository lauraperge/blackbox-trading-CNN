
TEX FILES TO CLEAN UP

- data: FX is needed because stocks, S&P500, etc. only available on trading days: proposes issue of weekends (remember later when evaluating)
- algo: momentum based / trend following ones are interesting for our goal (look at this for starters: https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp-community-tutorials/blob/master/Python%20Finance%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Python%20For%20Finance%20Beginners%20Tutorial.ipynb)
- GEMINI BTCUSD DATA: USE ONLY UNTIL 2018/08/23 01:50:00 some missing after
- backtesting: 
pitfalls: external events, liquidity constraints, model overfit, lookahead
components: strategy, P&L calc.
- for later: cross validation and model selection (approach - ts or we can ignore the fact that it is ts)
- careful with lookahead bias (even at the time of normalization)
- when labelling data: window size determines the size of trend windows recognized, if I have an image, I want it to be labelled according to the latest data point
