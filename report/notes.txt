FOR NEXT TIME:

->> labelled_image_preparation: make sure that output is ready for CNN (datacamp.com/community/tutorials/cnn-tensorflow-python)
->> once this is ready: run everything thru one dataset in notebook
->> then write down relevant Intro and Methodology Points 


- data: FX is needed because stocks, S&P500, etc. only available on trading days: proposes issue of weekends (remember later when evaluating)
- algo: momentum based / trend following ones are interesting for our goal (look at this for starters: https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp-community-tutorials/blob/master/Python%20Finance%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Python%20For%20Finance%20Beginners%20Tutorial.ipynb)
- GEMINI BTCUSD DATA: USE ONLY UNTIL 2018/08/23 01:50:00 some missing after
- backtesting: 
pitfalls: external events, liquidity constraints, model overfit, lookahead
components: strategy, P&L calc.
- for later: cross validation and model selection (approach - ts or we can ignore the fact that it is ts)
- careful with lookahead bias (even at the time of normalization)
- when labelling data: window size determines the size of trend windows recognized, if I have an image, I want it to be labelled according to the latest data point
- only odd windowsize
- GAF: when scaled to [-1, 1] it is not bijective, (arccos on [0,2pi]) -> issue of not being able to recreate time series - if you can recreate ts then maybe you can figure out a missing value inputation
- GAF: right now we scale the series per window - is that a good approach?
    -> yes, because than the images are independent
    -> yes, it also solves the issue of having to create images for every CV round
    -> picture should not be dependent on entire distribution of data
    -> no, because then the picture is not specific for a dataset?
    -> no, because for small window size there will be a 1, a -1 and just a couple meaningful numbers
