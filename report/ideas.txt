- does it really have to be one specific time series? if I want independent pictures, what if I just feed a huge amount of data from a lot of FX, lot of other assets and then just use it on whatever
- for the end to potentially increase accuracy: small noise added and duplicate data (distort images)
- if CNN is not enough - what if I use combination of LSTM & CNN
    - Maybe Tiled-CNN

    - use DeCaf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.1531.pdf, https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_retraining
- make the images on the returns
