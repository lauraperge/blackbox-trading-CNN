\section{Introduction}
Trading on financial markets has been around for more than 200 years and with time, the internet, and technological advancement it has changed and evolved into what it is today:  
a versatile, international, online, easy-to-access, automated and truly immense beast. Its evolution is not over however, and the mentioned features make it the perfect subject 
of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Let us peak into the development of using algorithms and computational resources for trading using a summary by \cite{rialtohistory}. 

Employing algorithms in trading for calculation of asset prices goes back to the beginning of the 20th century and in the early 1950s Harry Markowitz already brought computational finance 
to existence in the pursuit of portfolio optimization. During that time, the computational resources were inadequate to efficiently utilize these algorithms in trading. From the 1970s to 1990s, 
large-scale computerization, the introduction of PCs, the internet and then amongst other systems the ECN (Electronic Communication Network) completely changed the game. Automation became a 
feasible solution, and algorithms are way faster to react with Buy/Sell orders on the market than humans. Trading is now not only for institutions or professionals and a chosen few but 
for every person with access to the internet. Intraday and high frequency trading emerged and so, using algorithmic trading strategies with automated execution has become crucial 
in order to trade on these markets. 

There is another important thing that has been around for several decades but has just gained space due to technological progress and the wide-spread access to computational 
power: machine learning and artificial intelligence. The first paper about creating a model of the human neural networks was \cite{mcculloch1943logical} and many more has followed ever since. 
One more important milestone for our topic was the first CNN (convolutional neural network) by \cite{fukushima1979neural} which is the first deep learning model for handwritten character and other 
pattern recognition.

HERE STATE WHY USE CNN: popular, good results, feature extraction, finds deeper connections in data...

THEN: time series analysis, RNN, LSTM used for algotrading, ... But these models many times fail to predict prices and there is a higher error rate if we want to figure out tomorrows return... 
Therefore, our model will not predict the next element of the series, but it learns to recognize periods, in the end of which you should make a buying or selling order. (...)


\textbf{TO BE MODIFIED ACCORDING TO OUTCOME}
The goal of this paper is to develop a simple but powerful model that can make real time trading decisions utilizing convolutional neural networks. For this, we need to capture as much dynamic 
and static information from the one dimensional time series as possible which we achieve by turning them into images. The classification requires the labels to represent trading orders of "Buy", 
"Sell" and "Hold", these are preliminarily defined on the training set using a suitable algorithm. The ultimate objective is a compact multilevel trading model that takes care of both the creation 
of image representations and the prediction of financially successful trading strategies using these images for data that is fed to the model in real time. 
We should note, that this approach resembles the one recently published by \cite{sezer2018algorithmic} but the novelty represented in this paper lies in the methodology of 
the transformation of time series to images and our way of feeding them to the network. \textbf{(In the end we figure what are the differences really, but there should be quite a lot.
Keep stating innovations here.)}

In Section 2, we look at the path of publications that motivated and built the foundation of our approach. Then, Section 3 provides us with the information about the kind of data we use throughout 
the paper, moreover we introduce the methodologies implemented from the data preparation to the prediction phase. These include the transformation of one dimensional time series into images, 
how we proceed to create appropriate labels for these images, how we construct and train our CNN model on them and return predictions using the model. Furthermore, we propose a solution for an 
actionable pipeline that could potentially be tailored to fit into a production environment.
Afterwards, in Section 4 we examine the results and assess them in a three-fold manner:
technical fitness (how accurate is the classification?), financial profitability (how high are the returns?), swiftness (how quick is the model to come up with a prediction?). Section 5 concludes how much 
we closed in on grasping our objectives and what are some possible proceedings of this work.

\subsection{Deep CNN: Image Classification}
Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are artificial neural networks (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers (deep) that also employ convolution in one or more layers 
as a substitute for the matrix multiplication (see p.326, Chapter 9 in \cite{goodfellow2016deep}). 

Let us take a second to recap what we have so far. We have one-dimensional historical stock price data that we preprocessed and created images from the sliding windows of data points. We created 
labels of trading actions on our original data and then matched these labels to the relevant images. 

How to classify the images, why CNN, \dots, 
Introduce your base model - NOT DOING THIS YET BUT SKELETON:

1. Feed image representations in different channels for colors

2. Optimize number of layers, neurons - maybe tiled CNN

3. Add regularization

4. See if you can change the loss function to be minus return

5. Other additions/optimization?
