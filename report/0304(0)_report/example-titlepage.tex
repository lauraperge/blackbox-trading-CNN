\section{Introduction}
Trading on financial markets has been around for more than 200 years and with time, the internet, and technological advancement it has changed and evolved into what it is today:  
a versatile, international, online, easy-to-access, automated and truly immense beast. Its evolution is not over however, and the mentioned features make it the perfect subject 
of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
Employing algorithms in trading for calculation of asset prices goes back to the beginning of the 20th century and in the early 1950s Harry Markowitz already brought computational finance 
to existence in the pursuit of portfolio optimization. That time the computational resources were inadequate to efficiently utilize these algorithms in trading. From the 1970s to 1990s, 
large-scale computerization, the introduction of PCs, the internet and then amongst other systems the ECN (Electronic Communication Network) changed the game. 

Using automated computer algorithms to execute trading orders has become popular in the
